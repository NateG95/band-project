# Bon-Jovi Band Website

This website is designed for people who may or may not know the band, and are interested in their content. 
The website has four main navigation links at the top right of the web page: <b>Home,
Media, Photos, and Contact</b>. The Home page will contain a brief introduction of the band's history. The Media page
contains youtube videos of their tracks. The Photos page contains some of their pictures, and lastly the Contact page 
is where people can view Bon Jovi's tour dates and also a form for booking. The band's social media are located at the footer (bottom)
of the web page which opens up a new tab upon clicking.

## UX

My goal for the website design was to be simple and responsive on different viewports. I chose the 
black/gray/white color theme to compliment that simple design thought process. 

Things I implemented for the users: 

- A brief history for people who may not be familiar with the band.
- Media page that exposes users to the band's tracks.
- Photos of the band.
- Tour dates and a form that can be filled out for booking the band.

## Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
4. Font-Awesome (5.9.0)

## Features

##### This website uses:

- Tabs (Navs) feature in bootstrap which gives a box border when
hovering over the nav links.
- Bootstrap forms (Form Groups) to be filled out at the "Contact" page.
- Bootstrap Tables (Table Head Options) to display the band's tour dates
- Font-Awesome icons for the social media links.  
- w3schools "Slideshow"  which allows users to cylce through the photos.

##### Possible features left to implement in the future:

-  Tour dates in front of the web page.
-  News section for the band.
-  Social Media feed.
-  A shop section for merchandise.
-  A playlist that could play more of their songs.

## Testing

The site's table row for the tour dates couldn't be viewed fully on certain smaller devices such as tablets and smartphones.
Applied "table-responsive" on the table row to allow it scroll from left-right and vice versa. 

All fields in the forms section needs to be filled out. Otherwise it will send a pop-up message requiring you 
to fill out all of the blank text areas.

Clicking on all of the links (social media, videos, tour tickets) will open a new tab which prevents users from getting redirected from the current page.

The website was tested accross different web browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari)
and different devices ranging from smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop to make sure that there are
no errors regarding compatibility and responsiveness.

## Deployment 

- Created a new project at GitHub named "band-project."
- Pushed different versions of the codes throughout the development process.
- The web site is now deployed at github pages [here](https://nateg95.github.io/band-project/index.html)
