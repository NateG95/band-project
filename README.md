# Bon-Jovi Band Website

This website is designed for people who may or may not know the band, and are interested in their content. 
The website has four main navigation links at the top right of the web page: <b>Home,
Media, Photos, and Contact</b>. The Home page will contain a brief introduction of the band's history. The Media page
contains youtube videos of their tracks. The Photos page contains some of their pictures, and lastly the Contact page 
is where people can view Bon Jovi's tour dates and also a form for booking. The band's social media are located at the footer (bottom)
of the web page which opens up a new tab upon clicking.

## UX

As a user, I want to be able to:
 
- read a brief history of the band to get to know their beginnings
- go to their media page that showcase the band's music throughout the years
- see photos of the band that shows them performing 
- view tour dates and a form that can be filled out for booking the band for any events such as birthday parties, weddings,
  and many more.
- find links that leads to their social media and other media accounts (facebook, instagram, twitter, googleplaymusic, and youtube)

Prior to coding the website. I came up with these mockup wireframes on how I initially wanted the website to look:

- [Wireframe 1](https://github.com/NateG95/band-project/blob/master/assets/images/IMG_3645.jpg)
- [Wireframe 2](https://github.com/NateG95/band-project/blob/master/assets/images/IMG_3646.jpg)
- [Wireframe 3](https://github.com/NateG95/band-project/blob/master/assets/images/IMG_3647.jpg)

Originally I just wanted the website to have 3 pages. I couldn't get that to workout due to not having enough room
to fit in all of the contents, and I didn't want the website to be cluttered.


## Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
4. Font-Awesome (5.9.0)

## Features

##### This website uses:

- Tabs (Navs) feature in bootstrap which gives a box border when
hovering over the nav links
- Bootstrap forms (Form Groups) to be filled out at the "Contact" page
- Bootstrap Tables (Table Head Options) to display the band's tour dates
- Font-Awesome icons for the social media links 
- w3schools "Slideshow"  which allows users to cylce through the photos

##### Possible features left to implement in the future:

-  Tour dates in front of the web page
-  News section for the band
-  Social Media feed
-  A shop section for merchandise
-  A playlist that could play more of their songs

## Testing

The site's table row for the tour dates couldn't be viewed fully on certain smaller devices such as tablets and smartphones.
Applied "table-responsive" on the table row to allow it scroll from left-right and vice versa. 

Clicking on all of the links (social media, videos, tour tickets) will open a new tab which prevents users from getting redirected from the current page.

The website was tested accross different web browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari)
and different devices ranging from smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop to make sure that there are
no errors regarding compatibility and responsiveness.

- I tested the responsivenss of the website in web development through Chrome. Changing the viewports to see how
  it responds
- Sent it to my mentor to be tested
- Used mobile phone for testing

## Deployment 

- Created a new project at GitHub named "band-project"
- Pushed different versions of the codes throughout the development process
- The web site is now deployed at github pages [here](https://nateg95.github.io/band-project/index.html)
